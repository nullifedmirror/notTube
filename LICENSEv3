The POSS License Version 3.0.1
(Possibly Open Source Software License)

What?

The POSS license takes an alternate approach on open-source, taking into
consideration the current political state and the state of the programming
industry and tries to focus on core values instead of utter bullshit.
Furthermore, focus is put on attribution and fair-usage of code in which others
must publish their changes to the code base, although personal changes and experimenting with
code is fully allowed and are exempt from this rule.

Why?

In the 21st century we have managed to devolve further than before and have
managed to put politics into everything, including the software we make.
Most new licenses (and Code of Conducts) seem to enforce how we eat and breathe
instead of focusing on basic etiquette and that some words clearly are `X` because
they said so.

If salad and egg emojis are somehow offensive, then clearly we don't deserve to be
this technologically advanced.

Ok...:

Differences over other Licenses:
    · Much less scary looking text.
    · Addresses 2 annoying birds with a single stone.
    · Does politics politically incorrectly and correctly.
    · Includes the "Not My Problem™" clause.
    · This license cannot be revoked.
    · Allows for use of other licenses while maintaining the clause of this license.
    · Uses Common Sense.
	Since you still don't have that.

Differences over v2:
    · Added requirement of explicitly stating the CoC used.
    · Improve the language used.
    · Renamed the "Anti-Woke takeover" clause to the "Not My Problem™" clause
    · Added a ALL_CHANGES_PUBLIC akin to other licenses, i.e. AGPL	
    · Clarified license changes and handling other licenses.
    · Clarified license revocation.

The "Not My Problem™" Clause: (formerly the "Anti-Woke takeover" clause)
    · Do you have a project or codebase that chose political correctness over code?
    · Want to continue using it without the politically correct part and with your own fork?
    Then this license allows you to dump the original License and Code of Conduct,
    because you can, and replace it with the POSS License and (optionally) the Code
    of Conduct.
    Of course you can completely remove the Code of Conduct too.
    Unhappy because of this? Too bad.

License revocation:

This license under NO circumstances can be removed and all code licensed and formally licensed under the POSS license must use said license.
However, code using previous versions of POSS may upgrade their license to this version once and cannot return to the older version.

Changing license/re-licensing:

This license CANNOT be switched with another license, or re-licensed into another license. The POSS license ONLY allows the license
to be upgraded to a newer version of the license. (i.e. v1 -> v2)

Bi-licensing/Co-licensing:

This license CAN be used with other licenses as long as those licenses are included within the source code, HOWEVER the POSS license
takes priority over other licenses.

License design:

As this license takes a different approach to open-source and licenses, the license presents itself in a much
easier to understand format and puts the main focal points of the license within a simple table with explanations
for each component.

License table:

        NOTES:
            1. These values cannot be changed once defined.
            2. If placeholders like [YES/NO] are present in the table then consider the license invalid.
		! The value of these placeholders can be placed in the README.md file of source-code repos, this is ALLOWED.

Table explanation:
    BASE:
		- You, the user, are freely allowed to use, modify, derive and fork this code, unless stated otherwise.
		- You, the user, MUST refer to the license table given in the software.
        - The original owner and all contributors will always retain attribution rights, no matter what.
        - The original owner can also decide to keep all usage rights, even usage rights.
            (Check ALL_RIGHTS_RESERVED if this is the case for this codebase)
        - This license defaults to the CoC 2.0, if it decides to include this CoC and unless mentioned otherwise.
            (Check the COC_VERSION for the version, if it is not present, assume 2.0)
    SOFTWARE_OS:
        The license has a strict term on making OSS (Open Source Software) into closed source software.
	    - If the answer is YES:
	     - Adding closed-source blobs is perfectly fine, as long it is disclosed that it includes them.
	     ! Software marked with ENFORCE_TRUE_OSS: Requires ALL parts of it to be open, this includes blobs.
	    - If the software is open-source and you wish to make it closed-source, then sorry to ruin your day, but this license prohibits that.
	    - If the software is closed-source and you wish to make it open-source, then you can, although you cannot go back.
	     - Closed-source blobs are exempt from this rule.
	     ! Software marked with ENFORCE_TRUE_OSS: Blobs MUST be made open-source too, or must not be included.
	    - If the answer NO, then the license treats it as a "view/analysis/research/use" only, meaning no republishing can made.
    SOFTWARE_PAID:
	    The license has strict enforcement on paid and free software definitions too.
	    ! ENFORCE_TRUE_OSS: The software must be free as in beer, no-buts.
	    - If the answer is YES: (and the software IS NOT a fork)
	     - You are allowed by the license to make the software paid, you should still include this license.
        - If the answer is YES: (and the software IS a fork)
	     - It depends the on the fork, if it has been paid for already, then see above.
         - However, if it is NOT paid, then you are forbidden from re-sale/sale of this product.
	    - If the answer is NO:
	     - Then it is free, even if forked or modified, you CANNOT make this product/software paid.
    SOFTWARE_3P_STUFF:
	    This license has laid back enforcement of attribution to third-party libraries.
	    Marking YES or NO will only act as a visual indicator to the end-user that other libraries were used in the product or software.
    SOFTWARE_WARRANTY:
	    This license DOES NOT support or provide any warranty.

	    It has so little warranty that here's some scary looking legal text to prove it.

	    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
	    EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
	    MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
	    IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR
	    OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE,
	    ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR
	    OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

	    Also this license doesn't care if you cause Pluto to no longer be classified as a Dwarf Planet again, your fault.
    ENFORCE_TRUE_OSS:
	    - If the answer is YES:
	     - This license forces ALL components of the source-code to be open-source, including any sub-components or blobs.
	     ! Check above definitions for any extra conditions when ENFORCE_TRUE_OSS is set to YES.
    ALLOW_PAID_FREE:
	    - If the answer is YES:
	     - The owner has made this paid software free to use.
	     - The SOFTWARE_PAID field MUST be changed to "YES (ORIGINAL)"
    ALL_RIGHTS_RESERVED:
	    - If the answer is YES:
	     - The owner retains all rights to the code.
 	     - The owner may reserve to use his/her rights at ANY point in time.
	    - If the answer is NO:
	     - The owner doesn't retain all rights to their code...that's about it.
    COC_VERSION:
	    - This provides the versioning of the CoC used, allowed values are NONE, OTHER, 1.0 and 2.0.
		! If OTHER is used then the CoC used MUST be stated.
		- "Not My Problem™" Clause Only
		 ! If there was a previous CoC used, DO NOT use the previous one.
    ALL_CHANGES_PUBLIC:
	    - If the answer is YES:
	     - ALL changes MUST be public and accessible to anyone.
	    - If the answer is NO:
	     - Changes DO NOT need to public and accessible to anyone.

Issues and FAQs:
	None
	
Clarifications:
	(1) The usage conditions of the POSS license:

		The POSS license allows You, the user, to freely use, modify, edit, derive code and software from POSS licensed software.
		This statement is valid even with ALL_RIGHTS_RESERVED, except unless stated otherwise by the owner.

		The license table should still be referred to as specific usage conditions may still apply.
			(i.e, The modified code _MUST_ be published or that the software _MUST_ be free to use)
