	The Probably Open Source License (1.0)
		(also known as POSS, for short)

	(and the "Common Sense CoC") [CoC - Code of Conduct]
What?
	The POSS license takes a different approach on open-source, avoiding any political views and focusing on some core
	low-iq apprehandable values like "not being a dick".

	Also replace the O in the acronym to an I for comedic purposes.

Why?
	In our 21st century-based "evolved society" it seems that politics ruins the core values of having a singular opinion, and even will seep into our software.
	A license should be simple not have fifty subpoints showing how to breathe and digest without insulting someone else.

	Furthermore, there seem to be people on the internet that go as far as modify old use terms like "black and white"-lists because history, and because we need to be
	"better and more accepting beings", even if we developers just want to code, and the consumers just want to use a product that isn't restrained by three hundred terms
	regarding how X, Y and Z is called and pronouced.

	We as a society have devolved to removing eggs from emojis, because it can hurt someone's poor feelings.
	(literally no-one cares)

Differences over other Licenses:
	- Less scary looking legal text.
		Because, be honest, how many of you have acutally read a EULA, License or any other legally bound document?
	- Address 2 birds with one stone.
		Because why not?
	- Does politics politcally.
		Because both sides are equally bad, centrists included.
	- Uses Common Sense(TM)
		Because thinking these days is quite rare.
		Also is a great antivirus solution.

The License:
	The following table shows the state of the current program and will have rules below that apprahended to table.
	The software developer must fill in this table before using this license.

		Main rule table:
		---------------------------------------------
		- SOFTWARE_OS:				[YES/NO]		-
		---------------------------------------------
		- SOFTWARE_PAID:			[YES/NO]		-
		---------------------------------------------
		- SOFTWARE_3P_STUFF:		[YES/NO]		-
		---------------------------------------------
		- SOFTWARE_WARRANTY:		NO				-
		---------------------------------------------

		
		Subset rule table:
		---------------------------------------------
		- ENFORCE_TRUE_OSS:			[YES/NO]		-
		---------------------------------------------
		- ALLOW_PAID_FREE:			[YES/NO]		-
		---------------------------------------------

	SOFTWARE_OS: (a.k.a. Is the software open-source?)
		The license has a strict term on making OSS (Open Source Software) into closed source software.
		If the software is open-source and you wish to make it closed-source, then sorry to ruin your day, but this license prohibits that.
			Although adding closed-source blobs is perfectly fine, as long it is disclosed that it includes them.
			(!!!) Software marked with ENFORCE_TRUE_OSS: Requires all parts of it to be open, this includes blobs.
		If the software is closed-source and you wish to make it open-source, then you can, although you cannot go back.
			Of course, closed-source blobs are exempt from this.
			(!!!) Software marked with ENFORCE_TRUE_OSS: Blobs must be made open-source too, or must not be included.
		If the answer is no, then the license treats it as a "view/analysis/research/use" only, meaning no republishing can made.

	SOFTWARE_PAID: (a.k.a. Is the software commericalized?)
		The license has strict enforcement on paid and free software definitions too.
		(!!!) ENFORCE_TRUE_OSS: The software must be free as in beer, no-buts.
		YES: (and the software IS NOT a fork)
			Then go nuts.
		YES: (and the software IS a fork)
			Then it depends the on the fork, if it is paid already, then you are allowed.
			However, if it is NOT paid, then you a forbidden from re-sale of what is already free.
		NO:
			Then it is free, even if forked or modified.
			(!!!) However if it is a fork then check if ALLOW_PAID_FREE is allowed, because if it isn't then you must set SOFTWARE_PAID to "YES (ORIGINAL)"

	SOFTWARE_3P_STUFF: (a.k.a Does the software contain any third-party libraries/etc.?)
		This license has laid back enforcement of attribution to third-party libraries.

	SOFTWARE_WARRANTY: (a.k.a Does the software have warranty?)
		No. This license DOES NOT support any warranty.
		It has so little warranty that here's some scary looking legal text to prove it.

		THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
		EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
		MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
		IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR
		OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE,
		ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR
		OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.
