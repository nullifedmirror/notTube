POSS: Probably Open Source License, Version 2.0
Includes: [CoC - Code of Conduct]
    · "Common Sense CoC" 1.0
    · "Common Sense CoC" 2.0

What:
    The POSS license takes an alternate approach on open-source, taking into
    consideration the current political state and the state of the programming
    industry and tries to focus on core values instead of utter bullshit.

Why:
    In the 21st century we have managed to devolve further than before and have
    managed to put politics into everything, including the software we make.
    Most new licenses (and Code of Conduct) seem to enforce how we eat and breathe
    instead of focusing on basic etiquette and that some words clearly are X because
    they said so.

    If salad and egg emojis are somehow offensive, then clearly we don't deserve to be
    this technologically advanced.

Differences over other Licenses:
    · Much less scary looking text.
    · Addresses 2 annoying birds with a single stone.
    · Does politics politcally incorrectly and correctly.
    · Includes the "Anti-Woke takeover" clause.
    · Uses Common Sense.
	Since you don't have that.

The "Anti-Woke takeover" Clause:
    · Do you have a project or codebase that went woke?
    · Want to continue using it without the woke part and with your own fork?
    Then this license allows you to dump the original License and Code of Conduct,
    because you can, and replace it with the POSS License and (optionally) the Code
    of Conduct.
    Of course you can completely remove the Code of Conduct too.
    Unhappy because of this? Too bad.

The License:
	The following table shows the state of the current program and will have rules below that apprahended to table.
	The software developer must fill in this table before using this license.

		Main rule table:
		-------------------------------------------------
		- SOFTWARE_OS:				[YES/NO]-
		-------------------------------------------------
		- SOFTWARE_PAID:			[YES/NO]-
		-------------------------------------------------
		- SOFTWARE_3P_STUFF:			[YES/NO]-
		-------------------------------------------------
		- SOFTWARE_WARRANTY:			NO  	-
		-------------------------------------------------

		
		Subset rule table:
		-------------------------------------------------
		- ENFORCE_TRUE_OSS:			[YES/NO]-
		-------------------------------------------------
		- ALLOW_PAID_FREE:			[YES/NO]-
		-------------------------------------------------

	SOFTWARE_OS: (a.k.a. Is the software open-source?)
		The license has a strict term on making OSS (Open Source Software) into closed source software.
		If the software is open-source and you wish to make it closed-source, then sorry to ruin your day, but this license prohibits that.
			Although adding closed-source blobs is perfectly fine, as long it is disclosed that it includes them.
			(!!!) Software marked with ENFORCE_TRUE_OSS: Requires all parts of it to be open, this includes blobs.
		If the software is closed-source and you wish to make it open-source, then you can, although you cannot go back.
			Of course, closed-source blobs are exempt from this.
			(!!!) Software marked with ENFORCE_TRUE_OSS: Blobs must be made open-source too, or must not be included.
		If the answer is no, then the license treats it as a "view/analysis/research/use" only, meaning no republishing can made.

	SOFTWARE_PAID: (a.k.a. Is the software commericalized?)
		The license has strict enforcement on paid and free software definitions too.
		(!!!) ENFORCE_TRUE_OSS: The software must be free as in beer, no-buts.
		YES: (and the software IS NOT a fork)
			Then go nuts.
		YES: (and the software IS a fork)
			Then it depends the on the fork, if it is paid already, then you are allowed.
			However, if it is NOT paid, then you a forbidden from re-sale of what is already free.
		NO:
			Then it is free, even if forked or modified.
			(!!!) However if it is a fork then check if ALLOW_PAID_FREE is allowed, because if it isn't then you must set SOFTWARE_PAID to "YES (ORIGINAL)"

	SOFTWARE_3P_STUFF: (a.k.a Does the software contain any third-party libraries/etc.?)
		This license has laid back enforcement of attribution to third-party libraries.

	SOFTWARE_WARRANTY: (a.k.a Does the software have warranty?)
		No. This license DOES NOT support any warranty.
		It has so little warranty that here's some scary looking legal text to prove it.

		THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
		EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
		MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
		IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR
		OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE,
		ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR
		OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.
